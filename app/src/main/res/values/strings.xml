    <string name="about_app_content">Smartbrick is an application that provides tools for making ecobricks. The way it works is that the user can scan an image of the plastic, to find out the results of the classification of whether the plastic is suitable for use as an ecobrick or not. After carrying out the scan, the user will be given short instructions regarding the steps that must be taken to make a suitable ecobrick. Apart from doing that, Smartbrick also provides articles related to ecobricks. In further development, there will be a reward system where users can get benefits from scanning plastic waste, and get rewards based on the most scanning history.</string>
